The program implements the functionality of the popular logic game **Sudoku**. The game is played on a 9x9 board divided into smaller 3x3 squares. At the beginning of the game, some of the cells are pre-filled with numbers. The player's task is to fill the remaining cells with values from 1 to 9 in such a way that each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 square. The program uses Sudoku boards that have a unique solution.
